# VIEWPORT AND RENDERING

Again, in upper right can choose render (or viewport shading) mode (wireframe, solid, rendered, etc.). Can also toggle X-ray, for easier see-through.

If focusing on rendering, may want to switch to **Shading workspace**.

Key **0** to toggle camera view. **F12** to render current camera view as image (menu **Render &rarr; Render Image**); can be saved to disk.

Render engine **EEVEE** is quick but not very accurate. **Cycles** (ray-tracing) more accurate but slow.

**Material Preview** shading mode uses EEVEE for fast rendering.

In camera view, to more easily position camera, hit **N** to bring up **View** menu and under **View Lock** check **Camera to View**:
