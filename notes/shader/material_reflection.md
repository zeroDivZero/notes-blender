# MATERIAL REFLECTION

Under **Principled BSDF** shader, material reflection mostly determined by **Metallic**, **Roughness**, and **Normal** properties.

## Metallic

Even though can be [0.0, 1.0], it's usually either 0 (non-metallic) or 1 (metallic).

## Roughness

Lower value for glossier or more reflective, higher for duller.
